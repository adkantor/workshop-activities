    "# Activity 8.01: Retrieving Data Accurately from Databases\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The goal of this activity is to fetch data and retrieve information from two tables, persons and pets, which are a part of the petsdb database.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The persons table has the following columns:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **id**\r\n",
    "- **first_name**: The first name of the person\r\n",
    "- **last_name**: The last name of the person (can be null)\r\n",
    "- **age**: The age of the person\r\n",
    "- **city**: The city where they are from\r\n",
    "- **zip_code**: The zip code of the city\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "As we can see, the ```id``` column in the persons table (which is an integer) serves as the primary key for that table and as a foreign key for the pets table, which is linked via the ```owner_id``` column.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The pets table has the following columns:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **owner_id**\r\n",
    "- **pet_name**: The name of the pet.\r\n",
    "- **pet_type**: What type of pet it is, for example, cat or dog. Due to a lack of further information, we do not know  which number represents what, but it is an integer and can be null.\r\n",
    "- **treatment_done**: This is also an integer column, and 0 here represents No, whereas 1 represents Yes."
