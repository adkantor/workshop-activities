    "# Model Selection Using Cross-validation on a Traffic Volume Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you are going to practice model selection using cross-validation one more time. Here, we are going to use a simulated dataset that represents a target variable representing the volume of traffic in cars/hour across a city bridge and various normalized features related to traffic data such as the time of day and the traffic volume on the previous day. Our goal is to build a model that predicts the traffic volume across the city bridge given the various features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 10000 records, and for each of them, 10 attributes/features are included. The goal is to build a deep neural network that receives the 10 features and predicts the traffic volume across the bridge. Since the output is a number, this is a regression problem."
